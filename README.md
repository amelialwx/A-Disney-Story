# CS171FinalProject
This is for our team's CS171 final project on Disney animated movies from a princess' perspective. 

The deployed website is [amelialwx.github.io/A-Disney-Story](https://amelialwx.github.io/A-Disney-Story/). It is recommended to open the site on Google Chrome, on a laptop with the optimal resolution as 1920x1080. 

The data is in the data folder, while the code is in the ImplementationCode. The belle_relationships.csv, cinderella_relationships.csv, elsa_relationships.csv are generated by the Python code in other_python_code.

The site is built up with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [D3.js](https://d3js.org) and [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/).
